//You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
// Define a function to add two linked lists
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
//Initiaalize the carry variable to zero
let carry = 0;

//create a new ListNode with a value of zero and assign it to sum
let sum = new ListNode(0);

// Create a currentNode variable and assign it to the sum
let currentNode = sum;

//Execute while loop 


//Return the next node of sum, which is the actual sum of l1 and l2
